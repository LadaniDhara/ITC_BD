# Git Workflow for Personal, Development, and Main Branches
The workflow follows a progression from the personal branch to development, and finally to the main branch.

# Best Practices

* Always pull the latest changes before starting new work into personal forked repo.

* Use meaningful commit messages.

* Test thoroughly before merging into development.

* Test development branch thoroughly before merging into main.

* Resolve merge conflicts carefully.

Following this workflow ensures a structured development process while maintaining code stability. Happy coding!
